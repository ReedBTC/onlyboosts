/**
 * BoostBox descriptor proxy — the lnaddress half of getting a boost to render
 * properly in Helipad.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * A keysend leg carries its boostagram inline, in TLV record 7629169, and
 * Helipad reads it on the first HTLC. **An lnaddress leg has no such channel**:
 * it sends the raw message as an LNURL comment and stops, which lands in
 * Helipad's third and last tier — `app = "Lightning Invoice"`,
 * `sender = "Lightning Invoice"`, no show, no episode, and `value_msat_total`
 * left as the leg's own amount, so a podcaster is shown one leg's sats as
 * though that were the whole boost. Measured on a real Helipad, 2026-08-21.
 *
 * BoostBox implements podcast-namespace PR #734: POST the metadata, get a short
 * stable URL back, put that URL in the invoice description. Helipad HEADs the
 * URL and reads the full payload out of an `x-rss-payment` header.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Four things that decided the shape of this file
 *
 * **⚠️ IT PROXIES BECAUSE OF THE KEY, NOT BECAUSE OF CORS.** That is the
 * opposite of `functions/api/lnurl.js`, which exists because recipients' own
 * servers omit `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`. Measured 2026-08-22, tardbox
 * answers with `access-control-allow-origin: *`, so the browser could call it
 * directly. It must not: the API key is shared and issued to us by name, and a
 * key shipped inside a 1MB public bundle is extractable by anyone, who could
 * then write records under our name and spend the operator's storage and rate
 * budget. The key lives in a secret binding and never leaves the edge.
 *
 * **⚠️ USE `tardbox.com`, NEVER `boostbox.cloud`.** Helipad's allowlist is
 * hardcoded in its own source (`src/boost.rs#should_fetch_metadata`):
 * `vec!["fountain.fm", "castamatic.com", "tardbox.com"]`. A podcaster-settable
 * `metadata_whitelist` is unioned with it and `fetch_metadata` defaults to
 * **false**, so a self-hosted instance needs every podcaster to add our domain
 * by hand. Worse, the upstream demo host answers a **HEAD with 405** — its
 * route declares only `:get`, and the `:head` handler exists only in the fork
 * tardbox runs. Re-verified live 2026-08-22: `tardbox.com` HEAD → 404 on an
 * unknown id (route present), `boostbox.cloud` HEAD → 405 while GET → 200. So
 * the documented host is the one Helipad cannot read.
 *
 * **⚠️ THE BODY IS AN ALLOWLIST, NOT A PASSTHROUGH.** These records are written
 * under our key and are served to podcasters as our attribution. Forwarding
 * whatever JSON the browser sends would let a caller put arbitrary fields into
 * a document that carries our name. `app_name` in particular is set here and is
 * not caller-settable, the same rule the `client` tag follows in
 * `functions/api/sign-boost.js`.
 *
 * **⚠️ IT FAILS CLOSED, AND FAILING IS CHEAP.** No key, no KV, a timeout or an
 * upstream error all answer without a descriptor, and the caller falls back to
 * the bare message — which is exactly what ships today. **A boost must never
 * fail because its metadata could not be stored.**
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS EXCLUDED FROM THE SERVICE WORKER'S CACHE (`isUncacheableMoneyRequest`
 * in `sw.js`). It sits under `/api/`, where the default is network-first with a
 * cached copy served offline, and a cached answer here is a descriptor URL
 * pointing at a PREVIOUS boost's metadata — so the podcaster would be shown
 * another payment's message, amount and episode attached to this one. Same
 * class of mistake as serving a cached bolt11.
