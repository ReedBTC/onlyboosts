/**
 * Keysend well-known proxy — the lookup that turns an lnaddress leg into a
 * real keysend, so the boostagram rides in the HTLC instead of a comment.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS ONE MUST BE PROXIED, AND FOR A DIFFERENT REASON THAN `/api/lnurl`.
 * LNURL is browser-facing by design, so those endpoints send CORS headers
 * almost universally and our proxy there is a *fallback* for the minority that
 * do not. `/.well-known/keysend/<name>` is a server-to-server convention —
 * podcast apps do this lookup from their backend — so providers generally set
 * no access-control headers on it at all. A direct browser fetch is therefore
 * blocked for a HEALTHY endpoint, and the client's catch reads that as "this
 * address publishes no keysend document", silently downgrading every leg back
 * to LNURL. That is exactly how BMB's own upgrade never fired. So this is the
 * route rather than the fallback, and there is no direct attempt before it.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT ACCEPTS A LIGHTNING ADDRESS, NEVER A URL — the same rule `/api/lnurl`
 * holds. The whole URL is built here from the address and the path is a
 * constant, so a caller cannot steer the outbound fetch.
 *
 * ⚠️ A NON-2xx IS THE ORDINARY CASE HERE, WHICH IS WHY THIS DOES NOT SHARE
 * `/api/lnurl`'s helpers. Most lightning addresses are LNURL-only and answer
 * this path 404, so that Function's contract — mirror the upstream status and
 * surface the recipient's own explanation to the donor — is wrong twice over:
 * there is no donor-facing failure to report (the leg pays over LNURL either
 * way) and a mirrored 404 would read as an error rather than an answer.
 * **Everything that is not a usable document is one 404 with one reason.**
 *
 * ⚠️ A 200 IS NOT A PROMISE OF JSON. `primal.net` serves its SPA's HTML with
 * HTTP 200 for unknown paths, which is three legs of the measured top-30
 * corpus. That is the same absent-endpoint case as a 404 and gets the same
 * answer; the client's strict pubkey check is the second line of defence.
 *
 * The document goes back verbatim. `keysendLookup.js` is the single parser, so
 * the shape rules (`pubkey` / `destination` / `nodeId`, the customKey pairing,
 * the strict node-pubkey regex) live in one file rather than two that drift.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOT RATE LIMITED, DELIBERATELY, AND THE SYMMETRY IS THE ARGUMENT.
 * `/api/lnurl` is the same shape — an unauthenticated GET that fetches one
 * fixed path from a host named in a public value block — and carries no
 * counter either. `/api/boostbox` has one because it WRITES, under our own API
 * key, to a third party. Nothing is spent here. If a counter is ever added it
 * belongs on both of these together, not on this one alone.
