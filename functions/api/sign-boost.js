/**
 * The signing oracle for the OnlyBoosts boost bot.
 *
 * A visitor who boosted without a Nostr account has paid a show and has no way
 * to put that boost in this index, because the index counts notes and they have
 * no key to sign one with. This endpoint signs a boost note for them under a
 * dedicated bot identity, and the browser publishes it. See `boost-login.md`
 * D1 (why a separate npub), D2 (the bot owns what it publishes) and D3 (both
 * paths classify as slug `onlyboosts`, told apart by `client_src`).
 *
 * ⚠️ THE PRIVATE KEY IS SERVER-ONLY AND NEVER REACHES THE BROWSER. It is a
 * Pages secret binding, set on BOTH Preview and Production. Unconfigured, this
 * endpoint answers 503 and the feature is simply off.
 *
 * Two bindings are needed and it refuses to run without either:
 *
 *   BOOSTBOT_NSEC   secret        the bot's key, nsec or 64-char hex
 *   SIGN_RATELIMIT  KV namespace  the rate-limit counters
 *
 * The signer is `functions/_shared/nostr-sign.js`, a vendored build rather than
 * an npm import, because this repo has no root package.json and the Functions
 * have no dependencies. **Proven under `wrangler pages dev`**: the bundle
 * imports, signs and self-verifies inside workerd, which was the one assumption
 * in D5 worth testing before anything was built on top of it.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT THIS ENDPOINT CANNOT DO IS VERIFY THAT ANYTHING WAS PAID, and no
 * cheap version of it can. Proof-of-payment was designed and rejected on
 * 2026-08-19: a preimage proves only that someone KNOWS the preimage, which is
 * the payer or whoever issued the invoice, so an attacker self-issues an
 * invoice for any amount and passes. A LUD-21 verify URL is worse, being
 * supplied by the same caller. Binding a note to a real payment would mean this
 * server issuing the invoices, which puts it in the middle of a money path.
 *
 * So the evidence standard here is the SAME as the donor-signed path's: the
 * browser's own observation of what settled. That is deliberate rather than a
 * shortfall. On the donor-signed path, possession of the key is what makes the
 * claim accountable; here there is no key to possess, so what stands in for it
 * is containment rather than proof:
 *
 *   - every note is published by ONE identifiable pubkey, so the bot's whole
 *     output is a single filterable set (`client_src = publisher-pubkey`);
 *   - `excludes.json` can remove all of it in one edit, reversibly;
 *   - the caps and the rate limit below bound what one caller can do with it.
 *
 * Worth keeping in proportion: the index already accepts unauthenticated writes
 * from the whole of Nostr, since anyone may publish a boost note from a burner
 * key and the collector will index it. What this endpoint removes is the
 * friction of generating a key, not the capability.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT IT MUST NEVER BECOME is a general-purpose signer. Everything below is
 * about one shape of one kind, and the validator is an ALLOWLIST so a new tag
 * in the template fails loudly here rather than being signed silently.

// characters and nothing more: the rest is the donor's own typed message, which
// is the feature rather than a hole in it. What it does buy is that this
// endpoint cannot be repurposed to sign something that does not even look like
// a boost.
//
// ⚠️ THE BANNER IS PINNED, NOT SKIPPED, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. The note
// now opens with an image URL on its own line, so the boost line is line two.
// The lazy fix is to test `/^⚡Just boosted /m` and let anything precede it —
// which hands a caller a free paragraph of arbitrary text at the top of a note

//

// which is exactly the set `validateBoostTemplate` REQUIRES. The two validators
// therefore accept disjoint shapes and neither can be reached by relaxing the
// other. `buildDonationNoteTemplate` in
// `login-widget/src/lib/externalBoostagram.js` is the builder they mirror.
