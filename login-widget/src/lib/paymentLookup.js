/**
 * Asking the WALLET whether a payment settled.
 *
 * WHY. A NIP-47 pay call answers only when the wallet is done, and Alby Hub
 * over LND is done when the payment settles — so an outbound HTLC that takes
 * longer than the SDK's 60-second reply window produces a reply timeout while
 * the sats still go through. Measured on a real boost, 2026-09-04: two legs
 * timed out at 60.0s, the third paid in 0.97s over the same connection, and
 * the node showed all three settled. Before this file the widget had no
 * second source of truth for such a leg: LUD-21 needs a verify URL the
 * provider may not return (Primal returns none), and a keysend has no
 * recipient-side check at all. So both legs rested on UNCERTAIN, the note
 * reported one of three splits, and nothing could ever correct it.
 *
 * The wallet itself is that second source. NIP-47 `lookup_invoice` takes a
 * payment hash and answers for outgoing payments too, and the widget holds
 * the hash for every leg it pays: the invoice's own, and for a keysend the
 * hash of the preimage IT generated. This module is the pure half — the
 * classification of an answer and the polling loop over one — with the
 * wallet call injected, so `scripts/test-payment-lookup.mjs` drives it with
 * no SDK and no relay.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ONLY CONSEQUENTIAL ANSWER IS `failed`, AND IT IS TRUSTED ONLY WHEN
 * THE WALLET SAYS IT IN SO MANY WORDS. `settled` flips a leg to PAID, which
 * is free to be wrong in the cheap direction (the donor is told they paid
 * and they did). `failed` hands the donor a Retry that re-pays, so it is the
 * double-payment surface: it is read only from an explicit `state: "failed"`,
 * never inferred from a missing field, a NOT_FOUND, or an error. Everything
 * short of the two definite answers is `pending` or `unknown`, both of which
 * mean "keep the leg where it is".
 *
 * `unsupported` is the wallet saying it has no such method (NOT_IMPLEMENTED,
 * or the SDK rejecting the response shape); the caller stops asking.
