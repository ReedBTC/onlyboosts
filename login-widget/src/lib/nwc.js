/**
 * Nostr Wallet Connect (NIP-47) client lifecycle for the widget.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *   - Hold a single NWCClient instance per session, lazily decrypted
 *     from the localStorage blob on first use.
 *   - Validate a freshly-pasted URI before persisting (round-trip
 *     getInfo/getBalance so we don't save an unreachable connection).
 *   - Encrypt-to-self before persisting; never write the raw URI to
 *     storage.
 *   - Surface a small subscriber API so the widget UI can react to
 *     connect / disconnect events without polling.
 *
 * Public functions are async because every operation either touches the
 * signer (encrypt/decrypt) or the wallet relay (getInfo/payInvoice).
