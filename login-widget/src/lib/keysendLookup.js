/**
 * Lightning address → keysend upgrade.
 *
 * Some providers publish `/.well-known/keysend/<name>` alongside the usual
 * `/.well-known/lnurlp/<name>`, naming the node pubkey plus the custom TLV
 * record that routes a payment to that account on a shared node. When an
 * address serves one, a `type: 'lnaddress'` recipient can be paid as a real
 * keysend carrying the boostagram inline in TLV 7629169.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THAT IS WORTH DOING, IN ONE SENTENCE: Helipad's
 * `parse_boost_from_invoice` reads the TLV in its FIRST branch, before any
 * memo or metadata handling, so a keysend needs nothing switched on at the
 * podcaster's end and puts no third party in the path. The BoostBox descriptor
 * (route two, shipped) reaches the same podcaster through Helipad's second
 * tier, but only where they have enabled `fetch_metadata`, which defaults off.
 *
 * Measured across the top-30 shows' value blocks on 2026-08-21: 48 of 111 legs
 * were already keysend, 34 more are upgradeable and worth upgrading, 25 are at
 * `fountain.fm` and deliberately excluded below, and 4 publish no usable
 * document. So the upgrade takes tier-one coverage from 48 legs to 82.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERYTHING HERE IS BEST-EFFORT AND FAILS TOWARD LNURL. A miss, a timeout,
 * junk JSON, an SPA shell, a malformed pubkey and an unreachable edge all
 * resolve to null, and the leg pays exactly as it did before this file
 * existed. **Never make this throw.** LNURL works on every rail and keysend
 * does not, so the only safe direction of error is back to LNURL.
