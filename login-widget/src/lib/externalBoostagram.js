 * The Nostr note for a SITE DONATION: sats to OnlyBoosts itself, one leg at

 *
 * It is the boost note's twin by design — same banner-then-⚡-line shape, same
 * `👤 From` line on the bot path, same `💬 "…"` message — because a reader
 * should recognise it instantly as the same site speaking. What differs is
 * every machine-readable part, and that is the whole point of it being a
 * separate builder:
 *
 * ⚠️ IT CARRIES NO NIP-73 TAGS, NO BOOST TOPIC TAGS AND NO `amount` TAG, AND
 * ALL THREE OMISSIONS ARE LOAD-BEARING. This site's own collector decides what
 * is a boost in two places, and a donation must fail both:
 *
 *   - `scan.py` REQs `{kinds:[1], "#k": BOOST_FILTER_K}`, so a note with no `k`
 *     tag is never even fetched. That is what keeps the existing site tip out
 *     of the index today, and it is the outer guard here.
 *   - `classify.py` then sets `is_boost` from EITHER a `t` tag in
 *     {boostagram, value4value, boost} OR a positive `amount` tag. So carrying
 *     either one would make a donation an indexed boost the moment anything
 *     widened that filter — a boost to no show, in an index whose whole subject
 *     is podcast boosts.
 *
 * This follows the decision `FEED_GUID = null` already records: OnlyBoosts is a
 * client, not a podcast, so it has nothing to claim a boost against. The sats
 * figure lives in the note's own text, where a reader can see it and no indexer
 * will mistake it for a boostagram.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT IS WHY THE ORACLE NEEDS A SECOND SHAPE. `validateBoostTemplate`
 * REQUIRES `t=boostagram`, `t=value4value` and exactly one `amount` — the exact
 * three things this note must not have — so a donation cannot be signed by the
 * bot through the boost path. See `validateDonationTemplate` there.
