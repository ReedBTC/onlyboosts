/**
 * Ask the site's own signing oracle to sign a boost note under the OnlyBoosts
 * bot identity.
 *
 * This is the client half of `functions/api/sign-boost.js`, and it exists for
 * one visitor: someone who boosted with a wallet and has no Nostr account. The
 * index counts notes, and they have no key to sign one with, so a wallet-only
 * boost would pay the show and put nothing here. See `boost-login.md` D1 (why
 * a separate npub), D2 (the bot owns what it publishes) and D11 (the evidence
 * standard is the browser's own observation of what settled, the same standard
 * the donor-signed path is held to).
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS RETURNS A SIGNED EVENT AND PUBLISHES NOTHING. The endpoint never
 * touches a relay — an outbound socket per request is a second thing to abuse —
 * so the caller hands the result to `publishSignedKindOne`, exactly as it does
 * with an event a signer returned. The two paths differ in where the signature
 * came from and nowhere else.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY FAILURE HERE IS A FAILURE TO POST A NOTE, NEVER A FAILURE TO BOOST.
 * The sats left the wallet before this runs. The caller's copy has to say so,
 * and the offer has to be "try posting again" rather than anything that looks
 * like unwinding a payment.

 * the same split `CALLBACK_HOST_ALLOWLIST` lives with on the LNURL path.
 *
 * It is here so the modal can SAY SO rather than have a donor discover it: the
 * endpoint's own answer is `invalid amount`, which is accurate and tells
 * somebody who has just paid nothing about what to do.
 *
 * **It equals `MAX_SATS` in `ExternalBoostModal.jsx`, so in practice it never

 * instead, and Anon routing to this endpoint took that escape away. The guard
