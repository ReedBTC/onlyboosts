/**
 * External-episode boost orchestrator.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY SEPARATE from lib/payAllLegs.js (the LB boost path, the site's
 * #1 feature — untouched). This runs a Podcasting-2.0 V4V boost to another
 * podcast's value-block recipients:
 *   - lnaddress legs → LNURL-pay (reusing boostagram.js's stable leaf helpers)
 *   - node legs      → keysend (NWC pay_keysend / WebLN keysend) carrying the
 *                      boostagram as TLV 7629169 + the recipient's customKey/
 *                      customValue for shared-node routing.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND AN LNADDRESS LEG MAY BECOME A NODE LEG BEFORE IT IS PAID. Where the
 * address publishes `/.well-known/keysend/<name>` and the wallet can keysend,
 * `resolveKeysendUpgrade` swaps in the node the document names, so the
 * boostagram rides in the HTLC and reaches Helipad's first tier rather than
 * its third. See `keysendLookup.js` for what the upgrade is worth and for the
 * two rules that keep it from ever costing a payment: the wallet is asked
 * before the address, and `fountain.fm` is excluded despite qualifying.
 *
 * The probe adds one bounded round trip per distinct address, inside the leg
 * and therefore inside the wait. Prefetching it on mount beside the modal's
 * LNURL metadata is the follow-up if that ever shows; it is in the leg for now
 * because that is one place to get it wrong rather than two.
 *
 * Same best-effort model as payAllLegs: legs run sequentially (NWC reliability),
 * each in its own try/catch, and one failing leg never aborts the others — so a
 * wallet that can't keysend still pays the lnaddress legs (exactly how Boost Me
 * Bitch behaves). Never throws on partial failure; returns per-leg results.
 *
 * Wallet access is READ-ONLY against the existing facade: wallet.js for
 * status/payInvoice, nwc.getClient() for keysend, window.webln for WebLN
 * keysend. No wallet file is modified.
