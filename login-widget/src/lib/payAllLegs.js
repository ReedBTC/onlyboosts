/**
 * Multi-leg episode boost orchestrator.
 *
 * Given the recipients pulled from an RSS <podcast:value> block plus a
 * total amount, run N legs sequentially:
 *   1. Compute weight-proportional msats for each recipient.
 *   2. For each leg in order:
 *      a. Resolve the recipient's lud16 → LNURL endpoint (.well-known/lnurlp)
 *         (or skip if the modal pre-fetched the invoice during presign).
 *      b. Request a bolt11 invoice with comment = OnlyBoostsEpNNN
 *         (skipped for pre-fetched legs).
 *      c. Extract payment_hash from the bolt11.
 *      d. Maybe publish a kind 30078 metadata event:
 *           - Pre-signed event provided → publish that.
 *           - Recipient is in the META_PUBLISH_ALLOWLIST → build + sign
 *             with a single-use burner key, then publish.
 *           - Otherwise → skip the publish entirely. Recipients outside
 *             the allowlist (Fountain, guest personal addresses, etc.)
 *             don't run a bot that watches our boost relays, so the
 *             event would just be relay noise.
 *      e. Pay the invoice via NWC. Wait for completion before starting
 *         the next leg.
 *   3. Per-leg status callback fires after each transition (resolving →
 *      requesting → publishing → paying → paid|failed) so the modal can
 *      render live progress dots.
 *
 * Why sequential: NWC sends one encrypted request per payInvoice over
 * the wallet relay. Five parallel requests created contention in
 * production — a wallet processing a slow leg (e.g. minibits Cashu
 * mint) caused later legs' reply events to time out at the SDK's 60s
 * default. Serializing trades a few seconds of total latency for
 * meaningfully higher reliability. The SDK's `multi_pay_invoice` is
 * not used because the SDK currently fails the whole batch if any
 * single payment fails (per a TODO in the SDK source), which is
 * strictly worse than per-leg error handling.
 *
 * Best-effort semantics:
 *   - Splits aren't atomic in Lightning. If one leg fails (lud16 down,
 *     wallet rejects, relay error), subsequent legs still run. Caller
 *     reports per-leg outcomes and decides whether to surface a retry.
 *   - The whole orchestrator never throws on partial failure; it returns
 *     an array of per-leg results. Throwing would abort the modal and
 *     leave the donor wondering whether anything was paid.
 *
 * Key reuse:
 *   - One burner secret key signs the burner-signed legs of a single
 *     boost session (anonymous boosts, or attributed boosts where the
 *     user-signer fallback fired). This intentionally lets the recipient
 *     bot enumerate "all burner-signed legs of the same boost" by author
 *     pubkey — useful for analytics — without leaking donor identity.
 *   - One UUID4 in boost_session ties legs together for the boost wall's
 *     session-level dedup. Generated here, or injected by the modal's
 *     presign step so a pre-signed event and the eventual payment carry
 *     a matching boost_session tag.
