/**
 * A boundary around one modal, so a render error in it cannot take the page
 * down with it.
 *
 * ⚠️ WITHOUT ONE, A RENDER ERROR UNMOUNTS THE WHOLE `createRoot` IT LIVES IN,
 * AND THE SYMPTOMS DO NOT LOOK LIKE A CRASH. Observed on a real boost,
 * 2026-08-21: `ExternalBoostModal` read a `useState` binding declared thirty
 * lines below it, inside a ternary branch that is only evaluated once a leg is
 * actually paying. About a second into the payment it threw during render, and
 * what the donor saw was:
 *
 *   - the modal vanishing mid-payment, with no message;
 *   - the payment completing anyway, because `payExternalBoost`'s promise is
 *     detached and does not care that its component is gone;
 *   - no Nostr note, because `phase` never reached 'done' and the publish
 *     lives there;
 *   - the page's Boost button dead until a reload, because the host root that
 *     renders the modal no longer existed to answer the next open.
 *
 * Four unrelated-looking faults, one missing line order, and nothing anywhere
 * saying "an error was thrown". **That is what this exists to prevent.** The
 * underlying bug is fixed and `scripts/test-boost-modal-render.mjs` guards its
 * shape; this guards the *class*, which is the part that will happen again.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS CONTAINMENT, NOT RECOVERY, AND THE COPY MUST NOT PRETEND OTHERWISE.
 * The component's state is gone, so if a payment was in flight this cannot say
 * what happened to it — and on a money path "it failed" is the one thing that
 * must never be guessed (see `confirmInvoiceSettled`). So the message sends the
 * reader to their wallet and explicitly tells them not to re-send, which is the
 * same rule the UNCERTAIN leg state follows for the same reason.
 *
 * Errors are re-logged rather than swallowed: `componentDidCatch` stops React
 * unmounting the root, and it also stops the error reaching the console on its
 * own.
