/**
 * ExternalBoostModal — boost another podcast's episode (Podcasting 2.0 V4V).
 *
 * DELIBERATELY SEPARATE from EpisodeBoostModal / MultiLegBoostForm (the LB
 * boost path, untouched). This runs the external orchestrator (lib/
 * externalBoost.js): pays the episode's value-block recipients via LNURL
 * (lnaddress) and keysend (node), publishes NO kind 30078, and posts a kind-1
 * note tagged to the external show's guid + episode URL. Nothing here touches
 * LB stats/bots.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT IS DECLARED IN THE FORM AND WHAT WAITS FOR SETTLEMENT ARE DIFFERENT
 * THINGS, and the distinction is the whole design of this file. The INTENT —
 * whether a note is posted at all, and whose identity signs it — is declared
 * in the form, because it is a choice about the donor rather than about the
 * outcome, and asking for it on the done screen charges the friction to the
 * newcomer this flow exists for. The FIGURES are recomputed at the moment of
 * publishing, because a note reports what settled and no earlier moment knows
 * that (see `handleShare` and D14 in boost-login.md).
 *
 * ⚠️ ANONYMOUS AND PRIVATE ARE DIFFERENT ANSWERS TO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS, and
 * conflating them is what this file used to do. **Anonymous** is about WHOSE
 * name is on the boost: not your Nostr account, and optionally a name you type
 * instead. **Private** is about whether a note exists at all. So an anonymous
 * boost is still published, by OnlyBoosts, with no npub attached — which is the
 * whole point, because it means an anonymous booster still counts in the feeds
 * and the totals.
 *
 * The outcomes, all falling out of two controls:
 *
 *   as yourself, note on    the donor's own npub signs it, on their press
 *   anon + name, note on    OnlyBoosts signs it, the name is a line of prose
 *   anon, no name, note on  OnlyBoosts signs it with no name at all
 *   note off                nothing is published from any key
 *
 * Signed out there is no "as yourself", so the first row simply does not
 * arise; everything else is identical.
 *
 * Progress UI is self-contained (not the LB BoostProgressView) so the external
 * leg shape / skipped legs / keysend-uncertain retry rules stay independent.

 * ⚠️ WAITING IS NOT THE SAME EVENT AS GIVING UP, AND THE OLD SCREEN SAID BOTH

 * checking the rest — don't re-send them", in warning amber, and then held
 * that for up to ninety seconds without changing. Every word of it was true.

 * that cannot be hurried and never changes is indistinguishable from one that
 * has stopped working. Observed on a real boost, 2026-08-19: a leg to a slow
 * provider settled after about a minute, and the wait was the only part of the
 * boost that felt broken.
 *
 * So the two are separated. While the background watcher is running the donor
 * has NO decision to make — there is no Retry on an unconfirmed leg by design
 * — so the screen only reports that it is still working, and does it in copy
 * that CHANGES, which is the part that proves it is alive. The warning belongs
 * at the end of the watch, where a decision finally arrives, and that is where
 * it still is (see the give-up text the watcher writes).
 *
 * The stages escalate in patience, never in alarm. The one thing they must
 * keep carrying is that the sats may already be moving, since the double-pay
 * risk here is not a button — it is a donor who closes this modal and boosts
 * the episode again.

/**
 * ⚠️ THE LONGEST WAIT IS BEFORE THE WATCHER EVER STARTS, and CHECK_STAGES did
 * not cover it. Measured on a real boost, 2026-08-19, four legs through one
 * WebLN extension:
 *
 *   greyturkey26@primal.net   invoice 1.9s   pay  2.3s
 *   chadf@getalby.com         invoice 0.6s   pay 45.5s   → uncertain, settled later
 *   reed@getalby.com          invoice 0.8s   pay  0.4s
 *
 * So the donor sat in front of a spinner and one unchanging line for
 * three-quarters of a minute, and the escalating copy only began once the run
 * ended. **The hang is inside the wallet's own `sendPayment`** — same
 * extension, same session, two sibling legs answering in seconds — so nothing
 * here can hurry it, shorten it, or see progress inside it. What it can do is
 * say how long it has been going, which is the whole of CHECK_STAGES' argument
 * arriving one state earlier.
 *
 * ⚠️ The first stage is deliberately SILENT. A normal leg pays in one to four
 * seconds, and a reassurance that flashes up and vanishes is noise that makes
 * a fast boost look eventful. The line appears only once the wait is long
 * enough to be worth explaining.
 *
 * The ceiling these run under is the wallet adapter's, not this file's: 90s for
 * WebLN, ~60s for NWC's SDK. **Do not shorten either to make this tidier** —
 * the leg above took 45.5 seconds and then paid, and a tighter bound would have
 * turned a successful payment into an UNCERTAIN one.

   * UNCERTAIN leg is exactly the state in which the donor may still retry and
   * change what the note should say, so those get the button, and the screen
   * says which of the two it is. That is the "reports what settled" rule with

   * The one thing this costs is that a NIP-07 or NIP-46 signer prompt now
   * arrives without a press behind it. It is not unannounced — the donor asked
   * for the note in the form — and the screen names what it is waiting for. A
   * signer that times out lands in `shareState === 'error'`, which offers the
   * press back.
   *
