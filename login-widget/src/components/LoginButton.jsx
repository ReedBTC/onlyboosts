/**
 * The site's one "log in" control, in two skins.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT NOSTR, AND THAT IS THE POINT. This may be someone's
 * first contact with it, and they do not need to know that is what it is —
 * they need to know that logging in fills their details in. The word is **Log
 * in**, the mark is the site's own favicon, and the machinery behind it is the
 * Nostr login modal exactly as before. Same rule as the "Your name" field and
 * the "Private Boost" checkbox: no nsec, no npub, no relays, no keys.
 *
 * ⚠️ TWO SKINS, ONE CONTROL, AND THEY MUST STAY RECOGNISABLY THE SAME BUTTON.
 * A visitor meets it in the nav and then again inside the boost modal, and if
 * those read as two different things the second one is a stranger asking for
 * an account at the moment they are about to spend money.
 *
 *   `nav`      on the navy bar. Translucent white, sized to sit beside Donate.
 *   `checkout` on a light modal surface. Brand-bordered and full width.
 *
 * The `checkout` skin is the express-checkout shape a shopper already knows: the
 * mark and the verb, nothing else. It is offered as an ALTERNATIVE to typing a
 * name, not as a gate in front of it — which is why it sits **on the same line
 * as the From field**, right-aligned past it, with a small "or" between. It had
 * a full-width divider above it first and that was worse than the text link it
 * replaced: a rule across the modal reads as a section break, so the two halves
 * of one choice looked like two unrelated things.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT DOES NOT SET ITS OWN WIDTH. The caller does, because it is inline here
 * and full-width elsewhere.
