/* Shared lazy-loader for the login-widget bundle.
 *
 * The bundle is ~1MB and every page loads it on demand, but several
 * independent triggers can want it at once — on /feeds alone the nav
 * Boost button, a Podcast Boosts boost, an Articles action, and the
 * nav's bug-report item can each be the first to ask. Each trigger used
 * to own a private loader whose only guard was `window.LBLogin`, which
 * is undefined for the whole download. Two triggers in that window (a
 * podcast boost that first awaits /api/value, then a nav Boost click)
 * therefore appended a second <script> for a bundle already in flight.
 *
 * Measured, that costs one extra full parse+execute of the 1MB bundle —
 * not a second download: the HTTP cache serves the duplicate tag
 * (transferSize 0, one resource-timing entry), so the wasted work is CPU,
 * on exactly the click where the user is already waiting. The bundle's own
 * `!window.LBLogin` guard keeps the second execution from double-mounting,
 * so this was never a correctness bug — just a slow one.
 *
 * One promise on `window.__lbWidgetLoad`, shared by every caller
 * (including nav.js and the inline loaders in the page <head>, which
 * can't import a module and so reuse the same global by convention).
 * Resolves once window.LBLogin exists.
