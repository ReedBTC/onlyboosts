"""Shared primitives for read-only community-content collectors.

These are the relay-scan / verify / dedup / VPS-push building blocks used by
the community feed collectors (calendar events, marketplace listings,
long-form articles) and — going forward — anything else that caches
follow-pack-scoped Nostr content into a JSON file the website reads.

Design notes that matter to callers:

* Target kinds here are all ADDRESSABLE (30000-39999) — replaceable by
  `kind:pubkey:d-tag` coordinate, not immutable like kind-1 boosts. So dedup
  is by COORDINATE (newest `created_at` wins), and NIP-09 (kind-5) deletions
  are honoured against the whole accumulated store — see `newest_per_coord`,
  `collect_deletions`, `is_deleted`.

* Every event we cache is signature-verified first (`verify_raw_event`) —
  this content is served publicly from our own host, so we never want to
  re-serve a forged event attributed to a community member.

Nothing here signs or publishes to Nostr. The only outward action is
`push_file_to_vps`, which callers gate behind their own flag.

    """REQ one or more filters against one relay in a single subscription,
    returning whatever EVENTs arrive before EOSE, the socket times out, or a hard
    wall-clock / event-count cap is hit (partial results are kept, not discarded).

    `filt` may be a single filter dict or a LIST of filter dicts. A list is sent
    as one REQ carrying every filter, so a relay is queried for several
    kind/tag shapes over ONE connection and ONE EOSE wait — a dead relay then
    costs a single `max_wall_seconds`, not one per filter. The relay returns the
    union (each filter applied independently, e.g. a `#k` narrowing on only one).

    The per-recv timeout alone can't bound a relay that dribbles messages slower
    than `timeout` apart but never sends EOSE, so `max_wall_seconds` bounds total
    time and `max_events` guards against an unbounded backlog stream.

    Every failure is swallowed and reported as an empty page — a relay that is
    down reads as "nothing there" — except a handshake TIMEOUT when

    Every (relay, author-batch) pair is queried CONCURRENTLY (one task each,

    relays waiting out their timeout, so fanning out at the query level turns a
    long sequential crawl into a few concurrent waves. Fanning out per (relay,
    batch) rather than per relay matters when authors chunk into several
    batches: a relay that never EOSEs would otherwise burn one full
    `max_wall_seconds` per batch back-to-back inside its thread (three batches ⇒
    ~3× the cap on one connection); as independent tasks those waits overlap
    instead. `since=None` means full history (backfill); pass a timestamp for
    incremental. `max_wall_seconds` bounds each query — keep it tight on
    incremental runs, where a relay that hasn't EOSE'd quickly on a small
    since-window is effectively dead. Authors are chunked because many relays cap
    the `authors` array.
