# Metadata lookups (kind 0, kind 3, kind 10002).
#
# Chosen by measurement rather than by reputation, 2026-08-12, against the 61
# distinct boosters behind the 100 most recent boosts — coverage per relay,
# kind 0 / kind 10002 / kind 3:
#     relay.ditto.pub    80% / 42% / 67%
#     nos.lol            78% / 59% / 75%
#     relay.mostr.pub    47% / 36% / 47%
#     relay.wavlake.com  37% / 37% / 24%
#
# ⚠️ purplepag.es was here as the one DEDICATED profile aggregator, and the
# measurement is why it is not any more: it scored 32% / 37% / 50%, and its
# MARGINAL contribution once ditto and nos.lol are present was ZERO on every
# kind. Everything it held, they held. Don't re-add it on the reasoning that an
# aggregator belongs in a list like this; re-measure instead. Dropped for the
# same reason: relay.primal.net (6% / 4% / 18%) and relay.wisp.talk (26/24/16).
#
# wavlake earns its slot on this audience specifically — our boosters are
# podcast and music listeners, so the relay their boosts live on also carries
# their profiles. It beat purplepag.es on kind 0 and matched it on kind 10002.

# Kind-1 fallback set used by `publish_to_nostr` when an account has no kind 10002
# outbox to resolve. Trimmed in 2026-04 to drop chronically-flaky relays
# (nostr.band, snort.social, oxtr.dev, current.fyi) — they timed out on every run.
# Notes are no longer routinely broadcast to this set; the outbox model handles
# the normal publish path.
#
# A relay belongs here if it accepts kind 1 AND the podcasting audience reads
# it. relay.fountain.fm stays on the first count and earns the second outright:
# measured 2026-08-12, it holds a kind 1 for 60 of the 61 boosters behind the
# most recent 100 boosts, where no general relay cleared 44%. (The older note
# here justified it as a place "Fountain users often have profiles" — it
# returned no kind 0 at all in that measurement, so keep it for the notes.)
# chadf and podtards are added on the same reasoning: the collector already
# reads boosts from them, so they are demonstrably where this audience is.
#
# ⚠️ `wss://relay.getalby.com/v1` was in this list and is REMOVED. It is NWC
# transport, not a general relay: both it and the bare host answer every single
# REQ with `blocked: Request rejected`, so no reader can ever retrieve a note
# published there. NWC is unaffected — a wallet connection carries its own relay
# in the connection string and never consults this list.
