"""Local Bitcoiners — community podcast-boosts collector.

Read-only research/data bot — never signs or publishes anything to Nostr.
Scans the wider Nostr network for kind:1 podcast-boost notes authored by
everyone in the LB community (every npub currently on the supporters page,
i.e. the union of every follow-pack in bots/follow-packs/state.json), then
compiles what it finds into <repo>/data/community_boosts.json so the website
can build "episodes our community recommends" cards. This deliberately
excludes LB's own show (already covered by the episode pages) and is
podcasts-only for v1 (music apps like stablekraft are dropped once their
show's Podcast Index `medium` resolves to something other than "podcast").

Deliberately a SEPARATE bot, not a new sats-log pass — sats-log's timer also
drives the Tuesday leaderboard LIVE-publish on a strict schedule, and this is
a much slower/flakier network-wide relay scan that shouldn't risk that path.

## Boost detection

A kind:1 note qualifies as a community podcast boost when ALL of:
  1. It carries a NIP-73 `i` tag `podcast:item:guid:<guid>` (episode-level —
     bare `podcast:guid:<guid>` show-level mentions don't qualify).
  2. It has actual payment signal, one of:
       - a `t` tag of `boostagram` or `value4value`
       - a positive `amount` tag (msats)
       - it quote-references a kind:9735 zap receipt via a `q`/`e` tag or an
         inline nostr:nevent1.../note1... in the content — the real amount is
         read off that receipt's `amount` tag, falling back to its `bolt11`
         tag's encoded amount.
This last rule is what catches Fountain-style narrative notes with no
`amount` tag that actually wrap a real zap receipt (confirmed during design
research on one of Reed's own sample boosts — see project memory).

Network-wide discovery filters relays on `#k: [podcast:guid,
podcast:item:guid]` + authors — relay tag filters are exact-match only, so
`#i` filtering only works once a specific guid is already known. Known gap:
not every app emits the `k` tag (stablekraft doesn't) — low-stakes since
scope is podcasts-only and that's a music app anyway.

## Incremental state

bots/community-boosts/state.json (gitignored) holds `last_processed`, the
since-cursor for the next run. First run has no state file and backfills all
the way to SINCE_CUTOFF (10am EST Feb 2 2026 — per Reed, when the show
started). Subsequent runs re-query from a small overlap window before
last_processed; output is deduped by event_id so overlap is harmless.

state.json also holds `item_url_map` (item_guid -> canonical listen URL),
accumulated across every run. Each boost record carries `item_url`/
`show_url` — the third element of the NIP-73 `i` tag, when the booster's app
provides one (Fountain does; BoostMeBitch/BowlAfterBowl/PV4V don't). Every
run harvests any newly-seen URL for a given item_guid into the map, then
fills `item_url: null` on any boost of the same episode from an app that
didn't provide one — so an episode boosted via a URL-less app today still
picks up its link the next time anyone boosts it via Fountain.
