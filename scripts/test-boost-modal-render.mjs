/**
 * The boost modal's component body, checked for bindings read before they are
 * declared.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT EXISTS BECAUSE ONE OF THESE REACHED PRODUCTION AND WAS INVISIBLE UNTIL
 * A REAL PAYMENT WAS IN FLIGHT. `paySeconds` read `payTick` about thirty lines
 * above its `useState`, which is a temporal dead zone — but the read sits
 * inside a ternary, `payingLeg?.startedAt ? (… payTick …) : 0`, so the branch
 * is only evaluated once a leg is actually paying. The form rendered, the done
 * screen rendered, every test passed, and then a live boost threw
 * `Cannot access 'payTick' before initialization` **during render**, about a
 * second in.
 *
 * What that costs is out of proportion to the typo, which is why this is worth
 * a script of its own. A render error with no boundary above it **unmounts the
 * React root**: the modal vanishes mid-payment, the payment completes anyway
 * because its promise is detached, no note is ever published because `phase`
 * never reaches 'done', and the page's Boost button is dead until a reload
 * because the host root no longer exists. Four unrelated-looking symptoms, one
 * missing line-order.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS REPO HAS NO LINTER. `no-use-before-define` would catch this class in
 * one rule, and adding eslint to `login-widget/` is the better fix if anyone
 * ever wants it. Until then this scan is the whole defence, so **keep it
 * pointed at every component that renders during a payment**.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS A TEXT SCAN, NOT AN EXECUTION. A real render test would need jsdom
 * (state has to advance past 'form' before the crashing branch is reachable,
 * and `renderToString` runs no effects), which is a dependency this repo does
 * not have. The scan cannot see everything a renderer would; what it does see
 * is the exact failure that got us here, cheaply, with no new dependency.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/test-boost-modal-render.mjs

   * gives every asset URL a `?v=` so one version of one file can never meet

   * build for either. A browser holding `theme.css?v=ob-v94` in its four-hour
   * HTTP cache while fetching the widget fresh therefore gets **a new widget
   * against an old stylesheet**, which is precisely the `ob-v53` class of
   * failure the stamper exists to prevent, arriving through the one door it
   * cannot close.

   * computed-value time, so `background-color: var(--modal-bg)` resolves to
   * **transparent**. Observed 2026-08-21: the boost modal rendered as a
   * near-invisible outline over the dimmed page, mid-payment-flow.
   *
